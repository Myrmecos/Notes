1. cannot compile in-situ without creating a new project and moving everything to src (which seems wierd)
2. can we automatically javac a .class file into another file?
3. how to rename a file in intelliJ

## Update
1. no ideas how i solved it. probably: file -> project structure -> SDK -> 20
2. nah ?
3. donno
4. how to import a library: project structure -> Libraries -> select the file with all your libraries -> okay
